[Tessellated](https://tessellated.io) (formerly "Tessellated Geometry") builds and validates on proof of stake networks. We are technologists who operate small, independent validators on 12 networks across various ecosystems. 

Our members are active contributors to the ecosystem, contributing to projects like [Skip](https://skip.money), [Flashbake](https://flashbake.xyz).
